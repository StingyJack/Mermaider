This app should provide mermaid text-to-image or text-to-svg conversion as well as a live editor that can store images
or be a general static image host if there isnt one to forward the generated ones to.

## Working so far
-  live editor can do a graph exactly once before mermaid api shits the bed
- can get output from unit test from the command line

# next up
 - figure out the "get image" link
 

## Work in progress

- flags for diag output, filter and parse
- can edgejs work better for including node modules. maybe, but browserify is fine so far
- needs user file handling
  - "show my graphs"
  - "search for graphs"
  - "save work in progress"
  - "share graphs with others"
  - "collab edit"
