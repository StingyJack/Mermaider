# Mermaider
An Asp.net core (Mermaid)[https://github.com/knsv/mermaid] chart authoring and storage page.

I needed a learning project for some stuff, and something that could be used to perma-store charts and other images (without copying crazy urls).

Taking the whole bootstrap package wrecks the generated svg previews, so the gulpfile recompiles only the ones necessary.
